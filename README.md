Thinking...
First, the user's message: "make me like uber landing so i can take my drive". This seems like a typo or poorly phrased request. It might mean "make me like Uber landing so I can take my drive" – perhaps "make me like Uber landing page so I can take my drive"? Or "make me a landing page like Uber so I can take my drive"?

Interpreting user request
The user's message, "make me like uber landing so i can take my drive," appears to contain a typo or unclear phrasing.
It could mean creating a landing page similar to Uber's to facilitate driving, or something else like accessing Uber's landing for a drive.
Possible interpretations include "make me a landing page like Uber's" or "make me like Uber's landing page."
The exact intent is unclear, so further
